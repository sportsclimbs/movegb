I recently had a trip to the local climbing wall and ended up paying £44 to get in instead of the regular price of just £7.

So I'd thought I'd share my story to help others falling into similar traps and maybe start a wider discussion about the way internet companies manipulate people into schemes to get money from them.

So I've not been climbing for a good while and a friend invited me to a session at the local wall, Sheffield Awesome Walls. There is a scheme I knew she was on called MoveGB which is supposed to save you money when you sign up for a fixed period. The reply I got was a MoveGB link. It was invite to join the scheme for free for 10 days to tryout. This sounded perfect. I wasn't sure how much time I'd have to make use of it so the chance to try before you buy sounded ideal.

To get the free pass you have to commit to signing up for 4 weeks at the end of the trial though the website was clear that you could 'CANCEL AT ANY TIME' and there was 'NO COMMITMENT'. This is a little bit slimy but not that unusual. People are more likely to keep going if they have to make an effort to take themselves off and vice versa. So I signed up for the cheapest option as I thought it would best fit my use and then tried to book my session at the wall. Try as I might though I could not book a visit to the wall. Eventually I guessed I could only pick a session at the wall if I signed up to the more expensive tier of membership. I did this believing I could 'cancel at any time' and there was 'commitment'. I knew I just had to make sure to remember to do this before the end of the trial period.

The next bit of slime encountered was that I would still have to pay to go climbing. But it was only £1 (or at least that's what it said) so it was still a decent saving on the £7.

So I went climbing, enjoyed the session despite being completey unfit, went home.

The next day I got an email from MoveGB entitled 'Fair Usage Policy reached'. Just to be clear this was the day after I signed up, so the second day of the 'Free 10 day' trial and the only activity was one climbing session. The email didn't say much other than 

> you have used all the activities included in your MoveGB Passport for the of the 31-Oct-2019. Activities will be refreshed on 28-Nov-2019.

I could still use the pass but from now on I would have to pay, which I had to do even for the first activity.

This was pretty sh*t I thought. But I still believed I had at least saved £6 on entry to the one session at wall. I wasn't sure what to do so next so undecided I just left things to think about, but not forgetting that I would have to end my membership at the end of the ten day trial period.

Several days before the period was up I then got another email saying my account had been debited by £36 for the coming 4 weeks. I replied immediately asking to cancel and refund my money. I also checked the web site which stated that you would pay 'after' the trial period not before. I also complained about the supposed Free 10 days which in reality only sort of lasted one day, and even that was not free.

I received a terse but polite email ignoring most of what I had said and refusing to give me money back because it was against their 'refund policy'. In other words the claims adorning the sign up pages specifically highlighting NO COMMITMENT, and 'CANCEL AT ANY TIME' were BS as was the statement "After 10 days continue from only £1 per week." I'd been charged before the 10 days were up and there is no £1 option I could see on the web site. If you are trialling a service you should not be billed before the trial is up. The whole point of trial is to see whether you want to join.

Realising I was dealing with a bunch of slimeballs on a whim I decided to my bank balance just to see. It turned out things were even worse than I thought. The £1 I had paid to enter Awesome Walls was there but alongside it was an additonal charge of £6.90. I have no idea what that is for. On the website I clicked a button clearly marked with £1. I certainly didn't click anything marked £6.90 though. To pay more than the normal entry price would be absurd.

I have now deactivated my account but before doing I so noticed the previous £1 entry to go climbing had magically doubled to £2. To change the prices from the trial to the paid service is deliberate deception.  you were signing up to a scheme to get £1 entries 

So what I have learned. I've been using online services for 20 years now and this is the first and only instance where I feel have been properly ripped off. How did it happen? I think it was a combination of factors.

The first was
