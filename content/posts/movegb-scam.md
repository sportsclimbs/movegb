## How a 'free' pass cost me £44 to go climbing.

This is the story of how I was recently tricked into paying £44 for one session at a climbing wall. Hopefully it will help others avoid falling into the same trap.

A friend invited me to go climbing at Sheffield Awesome Walls and sent me what was marketed as a gift: a free 10 day pass for a scheme called MoveGB. MoveGB is a national organization that offers the chance to save money on any various exercise activities when used on a regular basis: yoga classes, gym activities and participating climbing walls.

Now probably like most of you I don't think of myself as a sucker for internet scams. However what I've learned is sometimes our defences can be down, and often that's no accident. Firstly because the pass was sent to me by friend already on the scheme I assumed it must be OK. Secondly I only had about an hour before meeting to go climbing so I rushed through the sign up process.

In retrospect I can now see that MoveGB uses so-called 'dark patterns'. That is UX tricks intentionally designed to manipulate people into things they didn't intend. These patterns are reinforced with dishonest claims that are are less easy to see without hindsight. (see darkpattens.org if you want to know more.)

The very first false claim was the 'free' in free pass. To redeem this pass you have to give your credit/debit card details and sign up for 4 weeks first. Reassurances are given at the top of the sign up page:

NO CONTRACT, NO COMMITMENT
CANCEL AT ANY TIME

The same message is reinforced at the bottom of the form in a quote from a MoveGB user: "You can freeze or cancel your account whenever you like".

The problem is none of these claims are true.

NO CONTRACT - obviously it's a contract and is even described as such on their terms and conditions page.
NO COMMITMENT - you are committed for 4 weeks.
CANCEL AT ANY TIME  - Nope. You can't you can only leave at the end of the 4 weeks.


'Free' does not mean it won't cost you anything. When I signed up I signed up to the cheapest scheme which was £3.99 per week. However the site wouldn't let me book my climbing session. After a frustrating 5 minutes trying I finally realised I had to sign up to the next tier which was £8.99 per month. This allowed me to book the session but I still had to pay £1 on top to go climbing.

This should have been a red light. It was obvious it was not free and I was being taken advantage of. But as £1 is not much, and I was now halfway through the form having already submitted my card details I just wanted to finish it and go climbing.

So I went climbing, signed in at the wall under the impression I'd got in for only £1.

When it says 10 day Free Pass you might think, like I foolishy did, that it means you get to use it for ten days. The next day though I got an email from MoveGB entitled "Fair Usage Policy reached":

> "you have used all the activities included in your MoveGB Passport for the of the 31-Oct-2019. Activities will be refreshed on 28-Nov-2019."

This seemed very strange. How could one day with only one activity be exceeding 'fair usage'? Was this a mistake? Is day 2 on 28th November? It made no sense. I was annoyed but as I still believed it wasn't costing me anything and I could leave at any time I wasn't overly worried.

I thought I wouldn't be charged anything until the 10 days was up because I foolishly believed the web site: "After 10 days continue from only £1 per week." (Quick translation: £1 means £3.99 and 'after' means 'before'.)

A few days before the 10 day period was up I got an email saying my account had been debited by £36 for the 4 weeks. I replied immediately asking them to refund the money and cancel the subscription. "Cancel at any time" right? I also complained about the fact I was supposed to get 10 days for free and I only got 1 day which wasn't even free but cost £1.

The terse reply I received simply refused to refund my money. The 'cancel at any time' claim meant only that you don't have to renew the 4 week 'no contract' contract if you don't want to. So it means nothing. Any an all contracts can be cancelled at any time by that definition. 'Cancelling' just means you don't have to renew when the contract period is finished. 

A couple of additional points:

1. When I checked my bank balance I noticed that next to the £1 charge for entry into Awesome Walls there was an additional charge of £6.90. So the cost for entry was £7.90 not £1. That's even more than the regular cost on the door which was only £7.00 at that time.

2. Now I'm on the scheme the £1 entry fee has been doubled to £2. If there's an addtional £6.90 on top it means that it's considerably more than even peak times.

So to recap: the MoveGB 10 day free pass gives you the chance to pay elevated entry prices provided you sign up for 4 weeks. It only lasts for one day though which in retrospect is actually a good thing. 

I've written to MoveGB again asking for the return of my money including the £6.90 they deducted for my one visit to the wall. I'm still awaiting a reply.
