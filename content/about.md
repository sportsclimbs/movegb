This site was first designed to provide info about the dark patterns and scammy nature of MoveGB

It's now being used to test more Hugo stuff including:

1. How the built site will functions locally
2. Putting on Netlify without a CMS
3. Maybe trying out Forrestry (how much?)
4. Uploading to sportsclimbs
