So this is a new file created via [coisas](https://coisas.fiatjaf.com/) online.

Here is bold text.

Not sure if the page is generated via Hugo. Iâ€™d guess not though it does have two title and date by default.

Though you can delete an entry and re-write it.

Looks like this cloud version only works with GitHub. You have to authorize through Github account from directly inside the Coisas interface and fill in your GitHub password.

Leave it at that for now.
